- Exploratory creative project using the REACT and ThreeJS.
- Modeled soldier movements in 3D space using Quadratic Bezier Curves.
- Deployed at [jeesh.com](https://jeesh.com)

- Built a REACT Single Page Application for logging indoor lead climbs.
- Utilized Express.js for the backend with a MongoDB database. Testing using Jest and Supertest libraries.
- Access the app at [here](https://indoor-climbing-log-2-0.onrender.com), compatible on all devices.

# Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm
- Implemented the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for Connect Four.
- Its game-agnostic design allows adaptation to other deterministic two-player games.
- Developed as a Major Project for COMP4121 Advanced Algorithms at UNSW, Australia.
